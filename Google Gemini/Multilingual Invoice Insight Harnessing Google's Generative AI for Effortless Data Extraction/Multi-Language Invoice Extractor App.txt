This Python codebase represents a Streamlit application built to extract information from invoices and provide translations. 
It leverages the power of Google's Generative AI and spaCy libraries, specifically employing the Gemini Pro Vision model for its image processing capabilities. 

key components:

1. Setup and Imports (Both Files):
Environment and Dependencies: Both scripts begin by setting up the necessary environment, including creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies like streamlit, google.generativeai, spacy, and googletrans.
API Key and Configuration:    The API key for accessing Google Generative AI is loaded from a .env file and used to configure the API client.
Model Loading:                The helper script specifically loads the gemini-pro-vision model, indicating its role in image processing and information extraction.


2. Streamlit Application (main):
User Interface:         The main script focuses on building the Streamlit application interface. It provides:
File Uploader:          Allows users to upload invoice images.
Image Display:          Shows the uploaded image for visual confirmation.
Information Selection:  Presents options for users to choose the specific data they want to extract from the invoice (e.g., invoice number, date, total amount).
Additional Input:       Enables users to input any further questions or requests related to the invoice.
Language Choice:        Offers a selection of languages for translation of the extracted information.
Submission Button:      Triggers the extraction and translation process.


3. Helper Functions (helper):
get_gemini_response:       This function interacts with the Gemini Pro Vision model. It takes the user's input, image data, and any additional prompts and sends them to the model for processing. The model's response, containing extracted information, is then returned.
input_image_details:       This function handles the uploaded image file. It extracts the image data and prepares it for processing by the model.
extract_information_ner:   Utilizing spaCy's capabilities, this function performs Named Entity Recognition on the model's response to identify and extract specific entities like dates, amounts, and organizations.
language_translate:        This function provides translation capabilities. Based on the user's chosen language, it translates the extracted information or user input using the googletrans library.


4. Processing Flow:
User Interaction:   The user interacts with the Streamlit interface, uploading an invoice image, selecting desired information, providing additional input, and choosing a target language.
Model Processing:   Upon submission, the get_gemini_response function sends the image, user input, and selected options to the Gemini Pro Vision model for analysis.
Information         Extraction: The model's response is processed by extract_information_ner to identify and extract relevant entities.
Translation:        If a language other than English is selected, the language_translate function translates the extracted information.
Output:             Finally, the extracted and translated information is displayed within the Streamlit app for the user.


5. Error Handling and Output Formatting:
Submission Logic:               When the "Tell me about Invoice" button is clicked:
Error Handling:                 Uses try-except blocks to handle potential errors like invalid options, missing files, or other exceptions.
Image Processing and Response:  Calls helper functions to process the image data and get a response from the AI model using the generated prompt and image data.
Information Extraction:         Uses another helper function to extract specific information from the model's response using Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Translation and Display:        If the selected language is not English, the extracted information is translated using the helpers.language_translate function.
                                  The extracted information (translated or original) is displayed using st.write and st.table functions depending on whether specific options were selected or not.
