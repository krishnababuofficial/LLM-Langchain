# Gemini AI Playground: A Streamlit Demo of Google's Gemini AI Integration Building a Text-based Bot and Image Understanding Tool

This Streamlit application demonstrates the integration of Google's Gemini AI models, showcasing their capabilities in interactive question answering and image-to-text generation.

## Project Overview

This project showcases my ability to:

- **Utilize advanced AI models:**  Integrate and leverage the power of Google's Gemini AI models for practical tasks.
- **Build interactive web applications:**  Utilize Streamlit to create a user-friendly and intuitive web interface.
- **Handle API integrations:**  Successfully connect to and utilize the Google Generative AI API for model access.
- **Implement best practices:**  Employ proper environment variable management for secure API key handling.

## Features

- **Question Answering (Q&A Bot):**  
   - Users can ask questions in natural language, receiving informative answers generated by the `gemini-pro` model.
   - Demonstrates the ability to process and understand text effectively.
- **Image-to-Text:**
   - Users can upload images and receive descriptive text summaries, showcasing the `gemini-pro-vision` model's image understanding capabilities.
   - Highlights the ability to interpret visual content and translate it into meaningful language.

## Technical Details

- **Libraries:** Streamlit, Google Generative AI, PIL (Python Imaging Library), dotenv.
- **Models:** `gemini-pro` (text-based), `gemini-pro-vision` (image-based).
- **Deployment:**  Runs locally using Streamlit.

## Future Enhancements

This project serves as a foundation for exploring further AI applications. I plan to expand it with:

- **Multimodal Interactions:**  Integrate other data types like audio or video for more diverse applications.
- **Advanced Prompts:**  Develop a more sophisticated system for user-provided prompts, enabling customized image analysis and text generation.
- **Personalized Responses:**  Explore user authentication and profiling to tailor responses based on individual preferences or past interactions.
- **Advanced Streamlit Interface:** Implement user-friendly features like progress indicators, better error handling, and custom styling.
- **Deployment to a Cloud Platform:**  Host the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) for wider accessibility.

I welcome contributions and suggestions for improvements!

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
*Use code with caution.*

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    - Create a .env file in the project's root directory.
    - Add your Google API key:
    ```bash
    GOOGLE_API_KEY =  YOUR_API_KEY --> (Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key.)

3. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py

## Notes
 - This project requires a Google Cloud account and access to the Gemini AI API.
 - **Security:** Never hardcode your Google API key directly into the code. Use environment variables as shown in the .env file.
