# Gradient.ai Powering Your Custom Language Models

This repository demonstrates how to use Gradient.ai to fine-tune a language model and build custom language models tailored to specific tasks. This project is inspired by the knowledge and guidance of Krish Naik and helpful discussions with ChatGPT.

## Project Goals:

* **Custom NLP Model:** Create a custom NLP model that excels at [**Insert your specific task here**]. 
    * (e.g.,  "answering questions about a specific topic," "summarizing articles," "generating creative text formats").
* **Personalized Knowledge Base:** Equip the model with a tailored knowledge base specific to your chosen domain. 

## Getting Started

**1. Gradient.ai Setup:**

* **Sign Up:** Create a free account on Gradient.ai: [https://www.gradient.ai/](https://www.gradient.ai/)
* **Create a Project:** Log in to Gradient.ai and create a new project.
* **API Key:** Obtain your API key from your project settings. You'll need this to connect your code to your Gradient.ai workspace.

**2. Project Setup:**

* **Install Requirements:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* **Data Preparation:**  Gather your training data. This will be in the form of "input-response" pairs (like the `samples` list in `main.py`). The more data you provide, the better your model will learn.

**3. Code Structure:**

* **`main.py`:** The main script for running the fine-tuning process.
* **`data_preprocessing.py`:** (Optional) Handles any data cleaning or formatting if needed.
* **`model_training.py`:** (Optional) Defines the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.

**4. Running the Code:**

1. **Environment Variables:**  Set the `GRADIENT_WORKSPACE_ID` and `GRADIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variables in your terminal or at the top of your code (`main.py`) using `os.environ['GRADIENT_WORKSPACE_ID'] = 'YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID'`.
2. **Execute Script:** Run the `main.py` script: `python main.py`

## Code Explanation (See `main.py` for details):

* **Load Base Model:** The code uses a pre-trained language model from Gradient.ai. You can choose the best model for your task (e.g., `nous-hermes2` as in the example).
* **Create Model Adapter:** A custom "model adapter" is created to fine-tune the base model for your specific task.
* **Data Preparation:** Your training data is formatted in a way that Gradient.ai understands.
* **Fine-tuning:** The model adapter is fine-tuned using Gradient.ai's API for a specified number of epochs.
* **Evaluation:** The code includes a basic evaluation step to compare the model's performance before and after fine-tuning.
