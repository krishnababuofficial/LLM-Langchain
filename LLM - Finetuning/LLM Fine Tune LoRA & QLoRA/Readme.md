# Llama 2 Fine-tuning with QLoRA

This repository contains code and instructions for fine-tuning the Llama 2-7B-chat model using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) for improved conversational capabilities.

### Project Overview
**This project demonstrates a practical approach to:**
* **Efficient Fine-tuning** : Utilizing QLoRA for memory-efficient training of large language models.
* **Custom Chat Models** : Tailoring the Llama 2 model to specific conversational tasks and datasets.
* **Model Deployment** : Sharing your fine-tuned model on the Hugging Face Hub for easy access and collaboration.

### Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch
* Transformers
* Datasets
* bitsandbytes
* peft
* trl
* huggingface-cli

### Installation
pip install transformers datasets bitsandbytes peft trl huggingface-cli
Use code with caution.
Bash

### Dataset
This project uses the mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k dataset, which is a 1,000-sample subset of the timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco dataset, reformatted for Llama 2 prompt compatibility. This dataset contains instructions and corresponding responses for training a conversational language model.
##### Dataset Download
You can find the dataset on the Hugging Face Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k
**Note** : The complete mlabonne/guanaco-llama2 dataset is also available if you want to fine-tune on a larger corpus.

### Model
We use the pre-trained Llama 2 7B Chat model from NousResearch: NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf.

### Fine-tuning with QLoRA
The code utilizes QLoRA to enable efficient fine-tuning on a single GPU with limited memory.
##### Key Parameters:
* **lora_r** : Dimensionality of LoRA matrices (default: 64)
* **lora_alpha** : Scaling factor for LoRA weights (default: 16)
* **lora_dropout** : Dropout probability for LoRA layers (default: 0.1)
* **use_4bit** : Enables 4-bit quantization of the base model (default: True)
* **bnb_4bit_quant_type** : Quantization type (default: "nf4")
* **bnb_4bit_compute_dtype** : Data type for computations (default: "float16")

# ... (Load base model, merge weights) ...
Use code with caution.
Python
2. Push to Hugging Face Hub:
!huggingface-cli login
model.push_to_hub(...)
tokenizer.push_to_hub(...)
Use code with caution.
Python

### Usage
Once you have deployed your model, you can use it in your applications or share it with others for testing and further development.

#### Future Improvements and Updates
* **Experiment with Different Datasets** : Explore other datasets relevant to your conversational use case.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning** : Fine-tune training parameters like learning rate, batch size, and LoRA settings to improve model performance.
* **Explore Advanced Fine-Tuning Techniques** : Investigate techniques like reinforcement learning or reward modeling to enhance model capabilities.
* **Integrate with Applications** : Build chatbots, conversational agents, or other applications that utilize your fine-tuned model.

##### Key Points to Remember
* Fine-tuning a language model can be resource-intensive. Make sure you have access to adequate computing resources.
* QLoRA is a highly effective technique for reducing memory consumption and enabling training on GPUs with limited memory.
* Regularly evaluate your fine-tuned model's performance using different prompts and datasets to ensure it meets your requirements.
