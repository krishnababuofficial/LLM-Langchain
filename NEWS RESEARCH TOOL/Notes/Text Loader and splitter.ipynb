A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nUnderstanding the GF Value\\nThe GF Value is a unique measure of the intrinsic value of a stock, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.\\n\\nAccording to GuruFocus Value calculation, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to be significantly overvalued. The stock's current price of $418.01 per share and the market cap of $1 trillion further strengthen this assumption.\\n\\nGiven that NVIDIA is significantly overvalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.\\n\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued?
